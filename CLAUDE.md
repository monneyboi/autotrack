# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Code Style

- Python 3.12+ compatible
- Use type hints for all functions and variables
- Follow PEP 8 conventions for naming:
  - snake_case for functions and variables
  - CamelCase for classes
- Use explicit error handling with try/except blocks
- Organize imports: stdlib first, then third-party, then local
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Document functions with docstrings
